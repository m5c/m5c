### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a professor in **Software Engineering Research**.  
My main interests are tools for RESTful Services, DevOps, Security Protocols, API Security, and all the empirical methodology needed to understand their effects on software engineers. That is: real, measurable effects on humans, and the software produced.

You can download my most important articles, video tutorials and teaching material on my [professional website](https://m5c.github.io/).  
For a full record of publications and co-authorship, see my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=WaOa-hcAAAAJ) page.
